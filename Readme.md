# Saturation
This is a fork of Alain Paul Mastering's demonstration plugin for his video series on distortion/saturation/soft clipping.
The goal here is to improve on the initial delivered product, experiment more with the possibilities and design of this particular effect and create a learning opportunity for other producers and developers. Unlike digital filters, reverbs or compressors, distortion is very simple to explain fully and the complex parts only come with describing the analog circuits that first made this effect popular.

## Current goal
- adding an asymmetric algorithm
- giving the choice of oversampling to the user through a button/knob
- explaining the critical parts of developing a qualitative plugin (in my humble beginner opinion)
